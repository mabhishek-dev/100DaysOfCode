Day #39<br>

Started with React today.<br>

Got to know what React is and why we use it. Learned about components and how they help organize code. <br>
Went through the project structure and what each folder/file is for. Also got a basic idea of how Virtual DOM works and the difference between a library (React) and a framework (Angular, Vue).<br>

Created the React app using Vite. Iâ€™ll be posting the react-app folder along with the CLI commands I used.
