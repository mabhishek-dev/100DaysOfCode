Day #13<br>

Continued with JavaScript today — wrapped up prototypical inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism. 
Finished ES6 classes — covered hoisting, the this keyword, inheritance, and method overriding.

Then went through modules (CommonJS and ES6), and just looked into Babel and Webpack.
