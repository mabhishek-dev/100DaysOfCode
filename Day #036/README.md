Day #36<br>

Learnt more about Promises today.<br>

Callbacks get messy when they keep nesting one inside the other. Promises help flatten the code and make it a lot easier to follow by chaining with .then().<br>

Also saw two more things:<br>

1. resolve can pass a value which is received in .then().<br>
2. Promise.all() lets multiple promises run at the same time and only continues once all of them are finished. <br>
This way we donâ€™t need to wait for one to end before starting another.
