Day #47<br>

Saw how `Alert` is set up using Bootstrap and React components. Learned about `children` and `ReactNode`.<br>

If we use a `text` prop, we can only do `<Alert text="Hello"/>`. Using children lets us do `<Alert>Something here</Alert>`, but if we want to include any HTML inside, we need ReactNode. This way we can do `<Alert>Hello <span>World</span></Alert>` and it works fine.<br>

Also added the React DevTools extension to my browser.
