Day #34<br>

Learnt about how Jasmine’s done() works and how it’s similar to Promises in JS.<br>
Promise is an inbuilt class (new Promise(() => {})) and lets us wait for async code before going to the next step using then().<br>
Also learnt how to get data from the backend with XMLHttpRequest. With callbacks it becomes async, so to handle that we use resolve and then.
