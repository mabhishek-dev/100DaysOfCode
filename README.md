#100DaysOfCode<br>
Started: August 1, 2025<br><br>

This is a 100-day challenge that I've started with the main objective of building at least 1 or 2 MERN stack projects.<br>
I have zero knowledge of any of the technologies except for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
But I'm gonna try to change that!<br>
I may not reach 100%, but even if I reach 50% in the next 100 days, that's a major accomplishment.<br>
I'm doing DSA in Java, which I will continue to post on my LinkedIn profile while I post my MERN status here on GitHub.
