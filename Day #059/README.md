Day #59<br>

Started an Expense Tracker in React today.<br>

Used useState to manage expenses and the selected category. Built a simple category filter with a dropdown (ExpenseFilter) and a table (ExpenseList) to display the expenses. Added delete functionality and dynamically calculated the total using reduce(). Table updates automatically when filtering or deleting.
