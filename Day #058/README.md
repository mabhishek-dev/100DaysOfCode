Day #58<br>

Today I got to know how React forms work using Zod. Instead of giving constraints inside register, we define them in a schema and use zodResolver. The errors come from the schema automatically, so we donâ€™t need to manually check min length or type.<br>

Also learned valueAsNumber: true for number inputs since HTML returns numbers as strings.
