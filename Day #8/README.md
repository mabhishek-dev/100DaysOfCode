Day #8

Technically started the course today — setup and installation was done yesterday. The course begins with JavaScript, so going through that properly from the start.
<br><br>
I’ve already done some of it before, so I just finished those parts. From the next session, it’s mostly gonna be new stuff. Sticking to this course to avoid jumping around again.
<br><br>
Also set up my terminal this morning (all installed using Homebrew):
<br>
• Installed iTerm2 and changed the color scheme using an .itermcolors extension
<br>
• Since I’m on Mac (which uses Zsh by default), set up Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k
<br>
• Installed Nerd Font (Hack) for icons
<br>
• Added zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and fzf
<br>
• Went with eza instead of colorls and aliased it to ls
<br>
• Also added zoxide for quicker cd commands
<br>
• Made changes in the .zshrc file for aliases and plugin configs
<br>
