Day #8

Technically started the course today — setup and installation was done yesterday. The course begins with JavaScript, so going through that properly from the start.

I’ve already done some of it before, so I just finished those parts. From the next session, it’s mostly gonna be new stuff. Sticking to this course to avoid jumping around again.

Also set up my terminal this morning (all installed using Homebrew):
• Installed iTerm2 and changed the color scheme using an .itermcolors extension
• Since I’m on Mac (which uses Zsh by default), set up Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k
• Installed Nerd Font (Hack) for icons
• Added zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and fzf
• Went with eza instead of colorls and aliased it to ls
• Also added zoxide for quicker cd commands
• Made changes in the .zshrc file for aliases and plugin configs
