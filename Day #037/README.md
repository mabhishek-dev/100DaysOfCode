Day #37<br>

Learnt about fetch() and how itâ€™s a better way to make HTTP requests compared to XMLHttpRequest. Instead of callbacks, fetch uses Promises and .then() to handle responses.<br>

Also learnt about async/await which is an even simpler way to work with Promises. async makes a function return a Promise, and await lets us wait for it to finish before moving to the next line.
