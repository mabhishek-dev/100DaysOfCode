Day #41<br>

Yesterday and today I worked with SQL using MySQL Workbench. Covered creating and altering tables, constraints, inserting/updating/deleting data, aggregate functions, grouping, having, joins (inner/left/right/full + exclusive/self joins), subqueries, views, and indexes. Finished the basics here.<br>

Also continued with React today. Learned about props and useState, used Bootstrap with components like List and Alert. Props let us pass data into components, and state helps handle dynamic updates.
