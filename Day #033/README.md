Day #33<br>

Got to know how frontend and backend communicate over HTTP. <br>
Learned about the request-response cycle where every request we send to the backend gives one response back.<br></br>

Also checked how XMLHttpRequest works in JavaScript. open is used to set the type of request and the URL, and then send actually sends it. <br>
The backend responds depending on the endpoint, and the response can be text, JSON, images etc.
