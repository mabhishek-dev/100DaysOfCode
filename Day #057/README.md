Day #57<br>

Got to know about formState in React Hook Form, specifically how errors works. Learned how to use register and handleSubmit to manage form inputs, validation rules like required fields and minimum length, and how to display error messages conditionally. This way, the form can show proper validation feedback for each field before submission.
