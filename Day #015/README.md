Day #15<br>
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game and Todo List<br></br>


Today I worked on two projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Both use localStorage, so the data stays even if you close the page.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: Fully working game that keeps track of scores.
Play the game here: [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://mabhishek-dev.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game/)

Todo List: Lets you add and remove tasks. Uses localStorage to remember them, and I added a button to switch between dark and light themes.
Use the todo list here: [To-Do List](https://mabhishek-dev.github.io/Todo-List/)
