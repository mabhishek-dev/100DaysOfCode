Day #24<br>

Continued with the project today.<br>
Got to know the difference between unit testing and integration testing â€“ unit testing is about testing a single function,<br>
while integration testing is about testing multiple pieces of code working together.<br>

Also came across the criteria for testing:<br>
1.How the page works<br>
2.How the page behaves
