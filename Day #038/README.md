Day #38<br>

Continued with async/await today. Got to know we can create errors when using XHR manually, and with promises we can also use throw, but with async we use reject(). <br>
For promises we can use .catch() after throwing an error, same with XHR, but async doesnâ€™t have .catch() so we need to use try...catch.<br>

Also got to know that await must be used inside an async function. Got to know how URL parameters worked.<br>

Finished going through JS concepts today, so will be starting React next.
