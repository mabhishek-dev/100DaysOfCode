Day #62<br>

It’s been almost a month since my last update. Exams got over on the 30th of October, and I just took the 31st off. Starting again from today, 1st November.

Now actually, before the last exam also, I didn’t sit quiet. I had an old iPad and got to know about jailbreaking and ended up jailbreaking it. Then I also got to know about custom ROMs like LineageOS and about bootloaders. I actually took my dad’s phone, unlocked the bootloader (which was super annoying because MI had a 1-week wait time), and then installed LineageOS. Was honestly scared that if I missed any step, the phone could get bricked.

After rooting, there were a lot of issues at first, but I finally got everything fixed. Now the phone is running completely clean with no bloatware, and it’s actually surprising how smooth and free it feels compared to MIUI, which was full of background stuff running all the time.

So yeah, even though I had exams, I was still doing other stuff in between. Now that exams are done, I’m back to the 100 days challenge.

I’ve started continuing React again. It’s been a while, so just getting used to the syntax again.

Also a huge thanks to all the people out there. Got to know a lot about open source, and after rooting, many of the modules and things I used were all because of GitHub and the people who made them.
